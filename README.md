* Implementing Functionality: Using JavaScript to handle user interactions, fetch data from weather APIs, and dynamically update the interface with real-time weather information.
* API Integration: Connecting the app to a reliable weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to retrieve current and forecasted weather data based on user input.
* Testing and Feedback: Conducting usability tests to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments before deployment.
   
technologies used:
* HTML: For structuring the content of the web app.
